# Predicting-the-profit-of-a-company-using-multiple-linear-regression

This project aimed to predict the profit of a company based on various factors such as marketing spend, R&amp;D spend, administration expenses, and location. I used multiple linear regression to build a predictive model for this purpose. 

The project will involve the following steps:

## Data Collection
I collected a publicly available dataset on kaggle.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset was clean so I didn't have to deal with missing values, outliers, or scale the data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
I then analyzed the data to gain insights into the relationships between the different variables. For this, I made use of a correlation matrix.

## Feature Selection
Based on the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis, I identified the most relevant features for predicting the profit.

## Model Building
I used multiple linear regression to build the predictive model. I trained the model with 80% of the dataset and validated it with the remaining 20% portion to assess its performance.
## Model Evaluation
I evaluated model performance using R-squared.

## Model Deployment
I then deployed the model to make predictions on new data.
