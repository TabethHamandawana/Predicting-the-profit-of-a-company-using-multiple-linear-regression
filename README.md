# Predicting-the-profit-of-a-company-using-multiple-linear-regression
The aim of this project was to predict the profit of a company based on various factors such as marketing spend, R&amp;D spend, administration expenses, and location. I used multiple linear regression to build a predictive model for this purpose. 
The project will involve the following steps:
**Data Collection**: I a collected publicly available dataset.
**Data Preprocessing**: The dataset was clean so I didnt have to deal with missing values, outliers, or scale the data.
**Exploratory Data Analysis**: I then analyzed the data to gain insights into the relationships between the different variables. For this, I made use of a correlation matrix.
**Feature Selection:** Based on the insights gained from the exploratory data analysis, I identified the most relevant features for predicting the profit.
**Model Building**: I used multiple linear regression to build the predictive model. I trained the model with 80% of the dataset and validated with the remaining 20% portion to assess its performance.
**Model Evaluation**: I evaluated model performance using R-squared.
**Model Deployment**: I then deployed the model to make predictions on new data.
